# Example - Iterating a csv of list ids to retrieve the list titles

An example of a simple golang command line tool which will iterate thruogh a CSV file off list UUIDs, call the API to view the list data, and write their titles back to another csv file.

You will need to set two envvars in terminal, specifying your API credentials:

```bash
export ACTIVE_TALIS_PERSONA_ID="my-id"
export ACTIVE_TALIS_PERSONA_SECRET="my-secret"
```

Then you can run the tool like this:

```bash
go run ./ -tenant broadminster -infile input.csv -outfile ./out.csv
```

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ If you are trying to use this example for a Canadian tenancy you will need to modify both the persona token URL and the RL API Base URL in the code,
as this example presumes the use of the non-canadian urls.
